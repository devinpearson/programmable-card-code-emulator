## About
While exploring Programmable Banking Cards, I found it difficult to test my code. I wanted to be able to write code and test it in a safe environment. I also wanted to be able to share my code with others. This project is an attempt to solve these problems.

### Installation

The emulator is available as an npm package. To install it, run the following command:
```
npm i programmable-card-code-emulator
```

### Usage

Import the emulator into your code:
```
const emu = require("programmable-card-code-emulator");
```

Create a new transaction object:
```
const transaction = emu.createTransaction(
    "ZAR", // Currency Code
    1000, // Amount in cents
    "0000", // Merchant code (MCC)
    "Test Merchant", // Merchant Name
    "Test City", // City
    "ZAF" // Country code
);
```

Run an emulation: 
```
// return a array of executions, as seen on the live logs
const result = emu.run(transaction, code, environmentalVariables);
```

## Todo List

 * Additional tests for checking that lodash, fetch and moment are available.
 * Additional exception handling for malformed code, invalid env etc.
